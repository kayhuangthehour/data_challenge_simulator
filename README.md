# data_challenge_simulator
python script to fully customize your own data challenge

# You can customize the data size, data types, 
# baking in common modeling challenges, distributions, multicollinearity, missing value, correlation, etc. 
# Also you can customize the true underlying model with defined functions, and hence you will have the theoretical AUC 
once the data set is generated. 

# Enjoy!
